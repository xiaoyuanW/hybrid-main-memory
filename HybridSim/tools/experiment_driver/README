Python Experiment Driver for HybridSim and marss.hybridsim.

The experiment_driver.py infrastructure enables the creation of experiment
sweeps with minimal effort. 

experiment_driver.py defines three classes:
* Command
* ExperimentDriver
* ExperimentHooks

Command is an infrastructure for generating chains of shell commands
from the most common commands needed to run experiments. ExperimentDriver
handles setting up and running each experiment.  ExperimentHooks defines
experiment-specific details (e.g. directory layout).

To use, create a subclass of ExperimentHooks and pass it to an instance
of ExperimentDriver.  ExperimentDriver will then call the various hook
methods to set up and run the experiments.
